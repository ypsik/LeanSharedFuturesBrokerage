# LeanSharedFuturesBrokerage

Crypto futures (perpetuals) brokerage integrations for [QuantConnect LEAN](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean), built on a single shared base class instead of one independent plugin per exchange.

All exchange clients are built on JKorf's `CryptoExchange.Net` ecosystem (`Bybit.Net`, `Bitget.Net`, `Aster.Net`, `HyperLiquid.Net`, `BingX.Net`, `Kraken.Net`, `OKX.Net`), which exposes a common "Shared" interface layer (`IFuturesOrderRestClient`, `IFuturesOrderSocketClient`, `IBookTickerSocketClient`, `ITradeSocketClient`, `IUserTradeSocketClient`, `IFundingRateRestClient`, `IKlineRestClient`, `IBalanceRestClient`). `SharedFuturesBrokerage` drives all exchanges through these shared interfaces, so order management, reconciliation, and funding-rate handling are implemented **once**, with per-exchange classes only overriding what's genuinely exchange-specific.

## Status

| Exchange | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bybit | ✅ Live | In-place order modify, funding fees via user-trade stream |
| Hyperliquid | ✅ Live | Vault trading, Builder Code support, cancel+replace workaround for post-June-2026 modify rejects |
| AsterDEX | ✅ Live | ListenKey user stream, hedge mode, Builder Code support, no native user-trade stream |
| Bitget | ✅ Live | In-place EditOrder, funding fees via ledger polling |
| BingX | ✅ Live | ListenKey user stream, hedge mode, funding rate via polling loop (not socket) |
| Kraken | ✅ Live | USD-quoted futures. Requires dirty fix for LEAN core bug. Described below |
| OKX | ⚠️ Blocked | Underlying library's `SharedClient` constructs native symbols as `BASE-QUOTE-SWAP`, breaking subscriptions for any non-BTC pair (`error 60018`). Waiting on upstream fix. |

## Architecture

### One base class, split by concern

`SharedFuturesBrokerage` is an `abstract partial class` implementing both `Brokerage` and `IDataQueueHandler` — order execution and market data/history live in the same class, split across files by concern:

- `SharedFuturesBrokerage.cs` — connection lifecycle, base wiring (`InitializeBase`), reconciliation timer setup
- `SharedFuturesBrokerage.Orders.cs` — `PlaceOrder` / `UpdateOrder` / `CancelOrder`, order state machine, socket handlers, reconciliation loop
- `SharedFuturesBrokerage.Data.cs` — `Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe` (`IDataQueueHandler`), `GetHistory` (klines + funding rate history), funding-rate rollover detection

Each exchange implementation (`BybitFuturesBrokerage`, `HyperliquidFuturesBrokerage`, etc.) extends `SharedFuturesBrokerage` and only overrides:
- Client wiring (`InitializeFromJob`) — passing the exchange's `SharedClient` instances into `InitializeBase`
- `GetCashBalance()` — every exchange has a different equity/PnL field combination
- `ExecuteUpdateOrderAsync` — in-place modify vs. cancel+replace differs per exchange
- `CreateFundingSubscriptionAsync` — funding rate delivery differs per exchange (ticker socket, mark-price socket, user-data socket)
- Exchange-specific `ExchangeParameters` (e.g. Bitget's `ProductType`, Bybit's `category`/`settleCoin`)

### Order state machine & `OrderStateManager`

Single source of truth keyed by `ClientOrderId` (permanent, assigned before the order is even sent), with a secondary O(1) index by exchange order ID for socket lookups. This exists because exchanges disagree on how a "modify" behaves:

- **In-place modify** (Bybit, Bitget): exchange order ID stays the same after an edit.
- **Cancel+replace** (AsterDEX, and Hyperliquid as a fallback): the exchange order ID changes after an edit, so the old `ClientOrderId` is re-pointed to the new exchange ID without LEAN ever seeing a spurious cancel event.

Lifecycle: `Placing → Submitted → Open/PartiallyFilled → Filled/Canceled/Replaced/Invalid`.

Trade matching (`HandleUserTradeSocket`) falls back through three tiers when a fill arrives:
1. Exact match by exchange order ID (O(1))
2. Fallback match by `ClientOrderId` (covers orders still in `Placing` state, or cancel+replace where the new exchange ID hasn't been mapped yet)
3. Heuristic match by symbol + side + quantity, for races where a fill socket message arrives before the placing/replace REST call has returned

A reconciliation loop runs every 30s, cross-checking in-memory order state against the exchange's actual open orders — catches missed socket events without continuously polling REST.

### Funding rate handling

Unified through `SubscribeFunding` / `CreateFundingSubscriptionAsync`, exposed to LEAN as `MarginInterestRate` data (forced into the live streaming path via `SharedDataChannelProvider`, an `IDataChannelProvider` override — LEAN doesn't stream this type live by default).

Rollover detection supports both:
- **Fixed-cycle exchanges** (Hyperliquid, 1h cycle): next funding time computed from wall-clock hour + `FundingRolloverHours`
- **Exchange-driven exchanges** (Bybit): `nextFundingTime` taken directly from the socket payload

Funding *fee* settlement (the actual cash movement, separate from the funding *rate* feed) is exchange-specific:
- **Bybit**: extracted from the user-trade-update stream, filtered to `TradeType.Funding`
- **Bitget**: no push event for fees — detected via a ticker-socket rollover trigger, then polls the account ledger (idempotent via last-processed-ledger-ID) after a short delay
- **AsterDEX**: pushed via the account-update stream (`AccountUpdateReason.FundingFee`), filtered from the ListenKey user stream
- **Kraken**: pushed via the `account_log` WebSocket feed, filtered to entries where `Info == "funding rate change"` and `RealizedFunding != 0`

### Minimum order notional

`MinimumOrderNotionalValue` is enforced per exchange (e.g. Bybit/Bitget $5, Hyperliquid $10). Quantities below the minimum are automatically rounded up to the nearest lot size that clears it, both on initial placement and on update.

### Symbol Properties Database (SPDB)

Populated dynamically at startup from each exchange's live instrument list (tick size, lot size) — not hardcoded. Hyperliquid additionally self-corrects tick size at runtime from live oracle-price ticks, since HL ties price/quantity decimal precision together (`szDecimals + pxDecimals = 5`) and tick size needs to track the asset's current price magnitude.

## Per-exchange notes

**Hyperliquid**
- Vault address trading supported (trades on behalf of a vault rather than the main account)
- Builder Code support: optional builder address + fee percentage (config-driven; defaults to the top of the allowed 0.001–0.1% range if an address is set without an explicit fee)
- June 2026 Hyperliquid network upgrade: in-place GTC modifies that would cross the book are now silently converted server-side to ALO/Post-Only and rejected (`"would have immediately matched"`). Worked around via cancel+replace that preserves the existing `OrderState` and avoids a spurious LEAN cancel event for the old order.

**AsterDEX**
- No native user-trade stream (`ExchangeSupportsUserTradeStream = false`) — fills are handled entirely through the order socket
- ListenKey-based user stream with a 45-minute keep-alive loop and automatic reconnect on expiry
- Optional hedge mode
- Builder Code support: optional builder address + fee percentage (same config pattern as Hyperliquid; defaults to the top of the allowed range if an address is set without an explicit fee)

**Bitget**
- No funding-fee push event — detected via ticker-socket rollover, then polls the account ledger
- In-place `EditOrder` modify with rotating client order ID per edit

**Bybit**
- In-place order modify; exchange order ID is stable across edits
- Funding fees extracted from the user-trade-update stream

**BingX**
- No native user-trade stream (`ExchangeSupportsUserTradeStream = false`) — fills handled via the order socket, like AsterDEX
- ListenKey-based user stream with 45-minute keep-alive loop and automatic reconnect on expiry
- Hedge mode by default, with `positionSide` (Long/Short) mapping per side
- Funding *rate* is not pushed via socket — handled by a dedicated polling loop that fetches the next funding timestamp, sleeps until settlement, then re-fetches rate + next timestamp
- Funding *fee* settlement pushed via the account-update stream, filtered to `Trigger == "FUNDING_FEE"`
- Order updates via `CancelReplaceOrderAsync`, which returns a new exchange order ID (cancel+replace under the hood, not a true in-place edit)

**Kraken**
- Futures are quoted in fiat USD (not USDT/USDC).
- Multi-collateral (flex) account: `GetCashBalance()` returns `BalanceValue` (haircut-free collateral value, PnL-neutral), letting LEAN add unrealized PnL separately via holdings
- In-place order modify (`ExchangeModifiesOrdersInPlace = true`): Kraken keeps the same order ID after an edit, same pattern as Bybit
- Funding fees pushed via the `account_log` WebSocket feed (snapshot on connect is ignored; only live `new_entry` events with `Info == "funding rate change"` are processed)
- Funding rates polled via a dedicated unauthenticated socket client (`_socketClientExData`) to avoid connection pool conflicts
- Requires the LEAN core dirty fix described below

## LEAN core bug: `IsCryptoCoinFuture` / EU MiCA

### Background

LEAN's `CryptoFuture.IsCryptoCoinFuture()` classifies a futures contract as coin-margined (inverse) if its quote currency is not `USDT`, `BUSD`, or `USDC`. Kraken Futures and OKX EU therefore quote all their linear perpetuals in **USD** (fiat), causing LEAN to misclassify them as inverse contracts.

This misclassification causes:
- `CryptoFutureHolding.GetQuantityValue()` to use the inverse formula (`quantity / price` in base currency) instead of the linear formula (`price × quantity` in quote currency), making `TotalHoldingsValue` equal to `Quantity` (e.g. `2.80` instead of `~163,000` USD for a 2.8 BTC position)
- `CryptoFutureMarginModel.GetCollateralCash()` to attribute collateral to base currency (XBT) instead of USD, breaking margin calculations
- `Portfolio.TotalPortfolioValue` completely wrong, causing incorrect position sizing in live trading

A [GitHub issue](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/9574) has been filed.

### Dirty fix (applied in `KrakenFuturesBrokerage`)

Since `IsCryptoCoinFuture()` is not `virtual` and cannot be overridden, the fix operates at the SPDB/ticker level:

1. **`NormalizeSymbol()`**: appends `"C"` to any USD-quoted ticker (`PF_XBTUSD` → `XBTUSDC`), so LEAN sees `quoteCurrency = "USDC"` and correctly classifies the contract as linear.
2. **`PopulateSPDB()`**: registers all Kraken futures with `quoteCurrency: "USDC"` to match.
3. **`NativeTicker()`**: strips the `"C"` back off before any Kraken API call (`XBTUSDC` → `PF_XBTUSD`).
4. **`GetSharedSymbol()`**: replaces `"USDC"` with `"USD"` in the shared symbol used by `CryptoExchange.Net` internally.

The USDC/USD spread is negligible for portfolio valuation (~0.01%). Config tickers must use the `USDC`-suffixed form (e.g. `XBTUSDC`, `TRXUSDC`) to match the LEAN-internal ticker.

## Known blockers (not exchange-side, library-side)

- **OKX**: `OKX.Net`'s `SharedClient` constructs native symbols as `BASE-QUOTE-SWAP`, which breaks subscriptions for any pair other than BTC (`error 60018`). Paused pending an upstream fix.
